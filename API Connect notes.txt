API Connect:

features :

1. loopback :

services, relationships, database tables, services - NoSQL, services - SQL

2. Hook

3. Analytics

4. transformation, Routing

5. Platform (any cloud including IBM cloud)

6. manage API - Rules

7.security

8. Consuming

9. Platform for all your API'security

10. REST services

11. WEB services

12. PLANS

13. Developer portal
===============================

Component of API Connect:

1. developer portal -  8 GB

2. Runtime Gateway like Microgateway, DataPower gateway -8GB

API connect does not have servers so microgateway (Node.js) and DataPower gateway are container where these services run - 8 GB

3. API connect  ToolKit(API Designer) - 8 GB - it has rest services to publish.

4. API Manager : it has Organisation which has Catalog having Runtime gateway like Microgateway, DataPower gateway  and Developer portal.

=====================================

To connect aPI Toollkit and API manager there is IP linked.

How to create the API Toolkit for development : has all the below

API designer (browser)

Command console (APIC console)

API Explorer :

First we need to install  Node.js then using npm install we can install APIC toolkit. (node.js contains microgate runtime) and its our responsibilty to intsall datapower runtime.

==========================================

for production we need : API manager, developer portal and datapower(run as docker container)
we cannot create Datapower in local as ibm provides datapower as VM. 

we cannot create Developer portal in local as ibm provides datapower as VM. (has IP)

we cannot create API Manager in local as ibm provides datapower as VM. (has IP). we need to create IP address of developer portal and datapower ip and give it in the API Manager Catalog.

==========================================
Command for installation.

To install node
node -v 

To install many comonents in node
npm -v

when we want to create services in node.js we need Express. run below command.. Express is a server to run rest service in node.

npm install express 

For API connect we have Microgateway server to deploy and run the service (also to run the proxy services) but to run the services written in node.js we need express server.

node -v 

v8.1.4

npm -v 

5.10.0

apic -v  for api connect verison

v5.0.8.4

// To install api connect :

npm install -g apiconnect

here -g is for global

//  for checking the error in js file

node --check index.js

// To install express

 npm install express
 
 // To install object-parser
 
 npm install object-parser
 
//if we made some changes in .js file so we can run this so that changes can be reflected nodemonitoring

npm install nodemon

// to uninstall node

npm uninstall 
 
==================

API Connect Toolkit:

//to install the toolkit from npm, below command

npm install -g apiconnect

// check if toolkit is installed or not

apic -v

// to open or start the api designer to create services. we cant create service without using pi designer.

apic edit

// We need to stop if we want to delete something. it will stop all ur servoices.

apic stop --all


// remove  ur existing copy of 'apiconnect' and clear the npm cache

npm uninstall -g apiconnect --cache-clear

//reinstall the toolkitnpm in

npm install -g apiconnect

// to download the specific version 

npm install -g apiconnect@apic-v5.0.8.1

// show all the commands 

apic

// Run this coomand when you do everything on local i.e on-premise
this command will skip the ibm bluemix cloud login each time. 1st time we will do in env for windows set is there

export SKIP_LOGIN=true

// To open the API explorer to test the services

apic explore

// to start a service but go the the folder and then run the command

apic start

// to stop a service but go the the folder and then run the command

apic stop

//if we want some inforamtion about  service go the the folder where service is located

apic services:get

// To create a service. we can create the services either by using UI or the command 

apic create --type typeOfService

apic create --type api (it will create rest api)

where typeofservice is rest service or web service or loopback or datamodel or datasource

//to get help
apic -h

to create Loopback project 
create folder 

// this is loopback command
apic loopback

// to create the relation between 2 tables  from same database or  2 tables from database

// we shoud have 1 primary key and foreign keys.
apic loopback:relation
 and ans the below question.

====================
Mongo db commands 

to connect to mongoo db
 mongo --host hostname
 
 to show databases:
 
 show dbs
 
 to show tables
 show collections
 
 to show all the rows in the tables/collection in the mongodb
 
 db.collectionName.find()
 
 use dbname;
 
 show collectionname
 
 ================
 
 hOOKS :
 
 WE CAN IMPLEMENT HOOKS IN LOOPBACK ONLY NOT IN REST SERVICE OR WEB SERVICES.
 
 WE have 2 files .js and .json for each table. we can inckude hook in .js file.
 
 ========================
 
 Restservice and soap are running in only one port i.e. 4001
 
 but the loopback runs on the 2 ports 4001 and 4002.
 
 4001 - for loopback
 4002 - for microgateway
 
 In Loopback application tehre is Loopback application which has its wn logic to communicate with dabase so it runs on another port and the gateway running on another port.
 
 2 types of hooks - operation and remote
 
 opertion : it is there for model object modulation. i.e. to get the access.  it talks about the method.
 
 remote : acts as a prehandle and posthandle in java. used for logging mainly. when u want to intercept, log, and ,odify information before and after
 a specific API operation. Remote hooks intercept message between the API endpoint and API application
 ============================
 
 condition : api.operation.id == 100
 
 ===========================
 
There aee various polies

IF

SWITCH - for normal switch operation

THROW

OPERATION SWITCH - for get/post/put and delete

HandleBars 

Map



XMLTOJSON

rest Service
https://services.groupkt.com/country/get/iso3code/IND

SOAP service
http://webservices.oorsprong.org/websamples.countryinfo/CountryInfoService.wso

===========

Docker is a container for VMS.

docker command:

docker -v
docker ps
docker inspect docker id
docker kill docker id
dcker logs dockerid
sudo apt-get install docker-ce(install docker engine)
docker info
docker pull ibmcom/datapower:latest
   https://hub.docker.com/ibmcom/datapower - this coommand will pdownload the outside docker to inside
docker run
Dcker has following components;

docker image
docker file
docker container
